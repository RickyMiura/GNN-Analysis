# Overview
This project is part of my Data Science capstone during my undergraduate program at the University of California, San Diego. In this project, I used Pytorch Geometric to implement different Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures and evaluated the performance of the models on different graph-structured data. In this repository, I provide the code accompanying my Quarter 1 Project Report which can also be found in the repository.
