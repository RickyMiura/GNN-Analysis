# Overview
This project is part of my Data Science capstone during my undergraduate program at the University of California, San Diego. In this project, I used Pytorch Geometric to implement different Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures and evaluated the performance of the models on different graph-structured data. In this repository, I provide the code accompanying my Quarter 1 Project Report which can also be found in the repository. 

# Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
```
GNN-Analysis/
├─ GATv2.py
├─ GCN.py
├─ GIN.py
├─ README.md
├─ graphGPS.py
├─ requirements.txt
├─ run.py

```
